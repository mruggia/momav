---------------

future:

	fixes:
		use wsl instances named momav, instead of Ubuntu20.04
		replace wifi antenna (?)
		arm 3 has damaged servo gears
		arm 5 outer bearing holder broken
		optitrack marker locations that are easy to calibrate
		use radio link instead of wifi (for lower latency?)
		"ssh -X momav@ground" crashes on CTRL+C (console.bat ssh ground trough wsl?)
		update install instruction to work if skipping sensors (e.g. x11 comes from t265) (also fix cmakelist.txt to detect missing libraries)

	code:
		model thrust als F=const*u^2 instead of F=const*u !!! (like in PX4)
		try to reintroduce optitrack latency compensation
		better synchronize controller_navigation -> controller_pose -> controller_wrench (ROS2!)
		dynamic_reconfigure
		warning/error when rosparam's are not present
		use imu to bridge gaps in optitrack wifi connection
		navigator vel/acc limits on all axes together, not each on its own
		navigator vel/acc rotation limits on rot-vec, not on yaw-pitch-roll
		navigator jerk control (force/torque change limit)
		PoM PID control
		failsafe on motor/servo failure
		horizon manual control for flying without position data
		improve arm servo time-delay by adding PoE term beside PoM term (?)

		estimate (RL) force/torque corrections with system identification
		implement/measure CoM offset & static wrench error
		polinomial model for motor force/torque curves (!)
		account for gyroscopic torque from moving spinning propeller disk
		account for battery voltage on force/torque
		analyze/redo force/torque calibration (including axis orientations)
	
	mechanics:
		esc after slip-rings (!)
		no folding props for less vibration
		add space for usb cables on top hex 3dprint
		sliding connection on servo + on inner bearing (possibly soft spacer) -> easier assembly & no pulling on servo
		screw-on brush-holder-pcb
		shield cap for motor cables at end of arms
		slightly more battery width space
		jst-zh connectors don't have good contact!
		inrush current mitigation (prevent arking on XT60 connector)
		use 12S batteries & copper sliprings & larger brushes (e.g. from type 895 motors) for efficiency
		use larger mavic 2 or 3 propellers
		custom pcbs (to save weight)
		pcb fixes described in 2_pcb/problems.txt
		direct connection between cpu & i2c splitter board (no cable)
	
	sensors:
		custom remote control (2x 3dof sticks + switches)
		IMU, swap MTi-3 with VN-100 or MTi-630 or Pixhawk for higher data rate
		esc with speed control and/or field oriented control
		gps (ublox ZED-F9P) (https://www.gnss.store/gnss-gps-modules/)
		sensor fusion for pose
		celular link
		fpv camera setup
	
	big stuff:
		upgrade to ros2
		takeoff/land on 3 arms instead of legs
		tetrahedron instead of octahedron shape
		aerial manipulator
